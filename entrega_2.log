LaTeX Warning: You have requested document class `estat/estat',
               but the document class provides `estat'.

Document Class: estat 2024-02-24 Standard estat class
! Undefined control sequence.
\default@ds ->\CalssWarning 
                            {estat}{\CurrentOption not declared!}
l.8 \ProcessOptions\relax
                         
The control sequence at the end of the top line
of your error message was never \def'ed. If you have
misspelled it (e.g., `\hobx'), type `I' and the correct
spelling (e.g., `I\hbox'). Otherwise just continue,
and I'll forget about whatever was undefined.
